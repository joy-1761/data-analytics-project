# 📊 Trading Algorithm Walk-Forward Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a detailed statistical analysis of an automated trading algorithm's walk-forward test over **92 trades** conducted between **May 19, 2020, and June 16, 2020**.  
The aim is to evaluate **profitability**, **risk profile**, and **trade behavior** using real trading data generated by the algorithm.

The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Python, with visualizations and probability simulations for deeper insights.

## ✨ Features

### **1. Data Preparation & Cleaning**
- Removed irrelevant or constant columns (`Ticket`, `Commission`, etc.).
- Converted string timestamps to datetime format.
- Standardized symbol names.
- Created derived metrics:
  - `Duration` (trade length in minutes)
  - `Profit Per Lot`
  - `Order Type` and `Direction`
  - Stop loss / take profit hit flags
  - Stop distance (%)
